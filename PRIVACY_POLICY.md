# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 28, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how MiauLog ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your information. MiauLog is a cat activity tracking application developed by Rodrigo Lisboa Mirco ("Developer").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data.

## Information We Collect

### Data You Provide

MiauLog allows you to track your cats' health and activities. The following data is collected and stored **locally on your device only**:

- **Cat Profiles:** Name, photo, birthdate, and weight of your cats
- **Activity Logs:** Records of activities such as eating, vomiting, medication, litter box usage, sleep, play, and notes
- **Preferences:** Your chosen weight unit (kg/lb) and time format (12-hour/24-hour)

### Automatically Collected Data

**Crash Reports:** We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and error logs. This helps us identify and fix bugs to improve the App. Crashlytics may collect:

- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- Crash logs and stack traces
- General diagnostic information

Crashlytics does **not** collect your personal cat data, photos, or activity logs.

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage

All your personal data (cat profiles, activity logs, photos, and preferences) is stored **exclusively on your device** using:

- SQLite database for structured data
- Local file system for photos
- SharedPreferences for app settings

**Your data never leaves your device.** We do not have servers that store or sync your data. We cannot access, view, or retrieve your personal information.

### No Cloud Sync

MiauLog does not offer cloud synchronization. This means:

- Your data is private and stays on your device
- If you uninstall the App or change devices, your data will not be transferred automatically
- We have no access to your data

## How We Use Your Information

- **Local data:** Used solely to provide the App's functionality on your device
- **Crash reports:** Used to identify bugs and improve App stability

We do **not**:

- Sell your data to third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Share your personal information with anyone
- Track your location
- Collect analytics about your usage patterns

## Third-Party Services

### Firebase Crashlytics

We use Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google, to collect crash reports. Crashlytics operates under Google's Privacy Policy. For more information, visit: [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

Crashlytics data collection is limited to technical information necessary for crash analysis and does not include your personal cat data or activity logs.

## Data Retention

### Local Data

Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You can delete all data at any time through the App's Settings > Delete All Data option.

### Crash Reports

Crash reports are retained by Firebase Crashlytics according to Google's data retention policies, typically for 90 days.

## Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

- **Access:** All your data is stored locally on your device and accessible through the App
- **Deletion:** You can delete all data at any time via Settings > Delete All Data
- **Portability:** Since data is stored locally, you have full control over it on your device

## Children's Privacy

MiauLog does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is designed for general audiences to track pet health information.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data:

- All data is stored locally on your device
- We do not transmit your personal data over the internet
- Photos are compressed and stored in the App's private directory

However, please note that the local database is not encrypted. We recommend using your device's built-in security features (screen lock, encryption) to protect your data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
